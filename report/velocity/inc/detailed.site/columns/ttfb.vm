    ## Well the problem is like this: Today there is no way to get the ttfb from PhantomJS so it is fetched by a extra request##
    ## using curl. Some sites that don't cache internally (and are slow) can differ quite much for ttfb, meaning ttfb can be higher the##
    ## next request than the load time the first time. That needs to be signaled.##
    ## The diff between ttfb and load time##
    #set($diff = $math.roundTo(3,$math.sub($math.toDouble($results.getAttribute("ttfb").getValue()),$math.div($math.toDouble($results.getChild("lt").getValue()),1000))))##
                        
    #if ($diff > 1.0)##
    <a href="#" title="The second fetch by curl took $results.getAttribute("ttfb").getValue() s, that is $diff slower than the load time the first request, probably the server have problems that you need to investigate."> <i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i>

    #elseif ($diff<0)##
        $results.getAttribute("ttfb").getValue()##
    #else##
        <a href="#" title="The ttfb ($results.getAttribute("ttfb").getValue() s) for the second request was $diff larger than the load time, you should check it."> <i class="icon-question-sign"></i>
