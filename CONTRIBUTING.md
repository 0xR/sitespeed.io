# How to contribute
Sitespeed.io continues to evolve thanks to people who contributes, so please please help out!

## Making changes
If you want help out, that's great! Check the issue list and see if there's something there you want to do and drop me a note so I know and I can help you get into the project.
One important thing: The YSlow file dependencies/yslow-3.1.5-sitespeed.js is generated from the project https://github.com/sitespeedio/yslow meaning all pull requests
needs to be sent to that project and then we will include the finalized javascript file in this project.

## Add a defect
First, check the [defect/bug list](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open) to make sure that it hasn't been filed yet.

If you find a defect, please file a bug report. Include the following:
 - Explain the bug/defect and what you where doing.
 - OS & versions
 - Always add the URL of the page you where analyzing (if it is secret, drop me an email peter**at**soulgalore.com and send me the address).
 - Add a screenshot and clearly point out where the defect is (if applicable)
 - Include the content of the data/error.log file in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and attach it to the issue.

If you have the skills & the time, it is perfect if you send a pull request with a fix, that helps me a lot!

## Add a change request/new functionality request
If you have an idea or something that you need sitespeed.io to handle, add an issue and lets discuss it there. Ideas/changes/requests are very very welcome!


Thanks for your time & support!
